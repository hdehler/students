# Project Ideas - Planner

## Project Idea
Overall, the planner app is a more in depth planner app with more features than just listing what you need to do, or plans you have. I want to create an app where you can customize the folders into multiple different sections such as 
* School
* Work
* Sports
* Activites

When we split these up into sections, it is easier to organize your self and the events you have planned. I invision a nice interface that is user friendly for everyone where you incremently add tasks that need to be completed. I want to make it so that there are text message notifications because for me personally, I always miss reminder notifications and swipe out of them, but I rarely miss a text message.

## Problem it Solves
The problem this program solves is that there is going to be more organization. Often times we find that just listing everything on a sticky note or in our notes app leads to being unorganized and you miss things that need to be done because they're just in a list. If we have all of these different categories, we can have everything in one spot. This is because we usually work in categories, we work on one category at a time.

## Major Features
1. Ability to add dates to the project/tasks
2. Ability to add diffrent folders/subjects
3. A main home page with all of the activities for the day - combined despite the category they are origninally in. This will make it easy for people to veiw daily tasks
4. Text message updates
5. I think this may be too difficult, but if we could make it so that cloud storage transfers over between devices. We could do it by having users sign up/login via google. 

## Languages
1. We are going to need to use some HTML or JavaScript for the web development for the website portion of this planner
2. C++ backend
3. As to mobile development for an app, we could use swift if we wanted to make it for iOS.

## Consumers
The people who may buy this product is those who want to be more productive during their days. Staying organized is a huge part of staying productive. When you have a program like this to lay everything out neatly and in their own folders so it doesnt look like a cluttered mess, people would buy this product rather than using apple notes. 
This product mainly targets those in offices or schools since they constantly have places to be, meetings to attend, deadlines to fulfill. There is alot to remember and its hard. Thats why this program is suitable for these types of people to help those with too much on their mind (with work) to stay organized.
